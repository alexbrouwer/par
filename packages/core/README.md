# PHP Additional Repository - Core

![GitHub tag (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/php-addition-repository/core?sort=semver&style=for-the-badge)

This package is part of the PHP Additional Repository. Additional documentation can be found at **TODO**.

## Installation

```bash
composer require par/core
```

This package depends on the pecl [Data Structures](https://github.com/php-ds/ext-ds) package. It will work without, but installing it will improve performance greatly.

To install this package run:

```bash
pecl install ds
```

## Credits

- [Rudi Theunissen](https://github.com/rtheunissen) and [Joe Watkins](https://github.com/krakjoe) for their work on the pecl [Data Structures](https://github.com/php-ds/ext-ds) package which in my opinion should be made available in the PHP core!
